# Solar Tracking Dual Axis Controller

## Introduction

This project is about a Solar Tracking Dual Axis Controller using an Arduino Uno board. The aim of this project is to increase the efficiency of solar energy capture by allowing the solar panel to follow the sun's trajectory throughout the day.

## Features

- Dual-axis control for comprehensive tracking
- Utilizes Arduino Uno for control logic
- Efficient and precise tracking algorithm

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno Board
- Servo Motors
- Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)
- Solar Panel
- Other necessary wiring and accessories

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Necessary Arduino Libraries (Servo.h, etc.)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the provided `.ino` file.
3. Compile and upload the code to your Arduino Uno board.
